Description.
We have to write a program which automotized cinema's work. It have to a menu -
1. Show the seats
2. Buy a ticket
3. Statistics
0. Exit

If we choose "Show the seats" - program to show us the picture with already buyed seats and free seats.
If we choose "Buy a ticket" - we have to enter the numbers of row and seat, which we want a buy.
Item Buy a ticket shouldn't allow a user to buy a ticket that has already been purchased.
If a user chooses an already taken seat, print That ticket has already been purchased! and ask them to enter different seat coordinates until they pick an available seat. Of course, you shouldn't allow coordinates that are out of bounds. If this happens, print Wrong input! and ask to enter different seat coordinates until the user picks an available seat.
When the item Statistics is chosen, your program should print the following information:
The number of purchased tickets;
The number of purchased tickets represented as a percentage. Percentages should be rounded to 2 decimal places;
Current income;
The total income that shows how much money the theatre will get if all the tickets are sold.
